# DeepMRSeg

> **_PULL PROPOSAL:_**  New Dockerfile and Dockerfile.log, generated by testing, describe creating and instantiating Docker images, and also pulling Docker images into singularity.  The Dockerfile contains annotations which may also be useful for creating other tensorflow Docker images.  deepmrseg_downloadmodel makes use of ~/.deepmrseg which works well for Docker but not for singularity.  I will request a pull from CBICA after the singularity use case is more robust.  --John Lee

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/abb2c20d73ed464180494bf2fed3f0eb)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/CBICA/DeepMRSeg?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=CBICA/DeepMRSeg&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade_Settings)

DeepMRSeg is a Python-based package for MRI image segmentation. The package is developed and maintained by the [Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA)](https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania. As the name implies, main modules of DeepMRSeg are built upon Deep Learning models that perform a set of image segmentation steps on MRI scans.

DeepMRSeg aims to provide users a ***robust***, ***accurate*** and ***user-friendly*** toolset for performing common segmentation tasks in neuroimaging. In order to meet these challenges, the development of DeepMRSeg was guided by the following set of fundamental principles:

* ***Efficient network architecture:*** DeepMRSeg uses a modified UNet architecture that combines an ensemble of learners for a robust segmentation  _[1]_.
* ***Model repository with extensively trained models:*** We provide a set of pre-trained models for various segmentation tasks. We applied model training using ***_very large and diverse MRI datasets_*** with carefully curated and verified ground-truth labels.
* ***Easy installation and application:*** Using a few simple commands, users can easily install DeepMRSeg on different platforms, download pre-trained models, and apply these models on their images. Most applications require no or minimal pre-processing; thus, users can directly apply them on raw scans.
* ***Extensibility:*** DeepMRSeg is built using a generic network architecture and a software package that allows extending it with minimal effort. The model repository will grow in the future with regular addition of new models and tasks.

## Supported Platforms
We have tested DeepMRSeg on the following platforms: 
-   Windows 10 Enterprise x64
-   Ubuntu 18.04.3 , 20.04.2
It may also work on other platforms.

## Prerequisities
-   [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   If you prefer conda, you may install it from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)

## Installation Instructions
To setup your GPU for use with tensorflow, please follow the tensorflow guide for [GPU support](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/gpu).

### 1) Direct installation at default location 
```
git clone  https://github.com/CBICA/DeepMRSeg.git
cd DeepMRSeg
python setup.py install #install DeepMRSeg and its dependencies
```

### 2) Installation in conda environment
```
conda create --name DeepMRSeg python=3.7.9
conda activate DeepMRSeg
```
Then follow steps from [direct installation](#direct-installation-at-default-location)

## Usage

After installation of the package, users can call DeepMRSeg commands on the command prompt (or on Anaconda prompt).

### Pre-trained models

Pre-trained models for testing are hosted in [DeepMRSeg-Models repository](https://github.com/CBICA/DeepMRSeg-Models). Users can manually download a model from the model repository into a local folder.

Alternatively, the model can be downloaded to a pre-defined local folder (_~/.deepmrseg/trained_models_) automatically using the command:

```
deepmrseg_downloadmodel
```

### Training and testing

Users can train their own model using a custom training dataset (training):

```
deepmrseg_train
```

or apply a pre-trained model on their image(s) (testing):

```
deepmrseg_test 
```

Note that _deepmrseg_train_ and _deepmrseg_test_ are generic commands that allow users to run training and testing in an exhaustive way by supplying a set of user arguments.

### Applying a task

Alternatively, we provide a simplified interface for the application of a specific segmentation task on user data:

```
deepmrseg_apply
```

Note that _deepmrseg_apply_ is a wrapper to _deepmrseg_test_, which calls it with a pre-defined model automatically downloaded using _deepmrseg_downloadmodel_.

## Examples

We provide here few examples using minimal argument sets as a quick reference. These examples also show 3 possible I/O options provided for different use cases (single subject, batch processing using an image list and batch processing of images in a folder).

### Testing

Quick application on single subject using the wrapper scripts and a pre-trained model:

```
# Download the pre-trained ICV segmentation model
deepmrseg_downloadmodel --model dlicv  

# Segment image
deepmrseg_apply --task dlicv --inImg subj1_T1.nii.gz --outImg subj1_T1_DLICV.nii.gz
```

Quick application for batch processing using an image list: 

```
#   User provides a csv file with columns: ID,InputMod1,InputMod2,...,OutputImage
deepmrseg_apply --task dlicv --sList subjectList.csv
```

Quick application for batch processing of all images in a folder:

```
#   Testing is applied individually to all images with the given suffix in the input folder
deepmrseg_apply --task dlicv --inDir myindir --outDir myoutdir --inSuff _T1.nii.gz --outSuff _DLICV.nii.gz

```

Segmentation using the deepmrseg_test command:
```
#    
deepmrseg_test --mdldir my/path/to/pretrained/model --sList subjectList.csv
```
Please see the user manual (or call the command with the -h option) for details of the complete command line arguments for deepmrseg_test.

### Training

Training a new model using the deepmrseg_train command:
```
#    
deepmrseg_train --sList subjectList.csv --mdlDir my/path/to/output/model 
```
Please see the user manual (or call the command with the -h option) for details of the complete command line arguments for deepmrseg_train.
